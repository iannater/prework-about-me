      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Ian and I have lived in Austin for most of my life. The company that I worked for recently sold and I am currently unemployeed
        and taking some time off. With COVID it has been pretty difficult to enjoy the time and do all the things that I told myself I would do if the prior
        opportunity ended. However, I was able to do a month long road trip through New Mexcio, to Colorado, Wyoming, California, and back to Texas. I slept in my car 
        and was able to see some of the most beautiful places and sights I have ever seen. I am now back in Austin and am excited to learn web development!

      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in San Francisco</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Surfing, Mountain biking, Hiking, and hanging by the lake at Emma Long park! I also love learning all things watches and cars.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I like building customer support teams and great software tools to empower those teams. Being able to continuously do this for companies I believe in is a dream. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Austin, Texas!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I recently exited a coffee technology company here in Austin as part of a sale and am taking a little bit of time off.
        A big part of what I did at Briggo was build and run our 24/7 customer and machine support team. A lof of this required
        custom software and because of that I got to work closely with our developers to build requirements. Through this work I
        became fascinated with development. I have seen first hand what an impact great software tools can make and how helpful they can be to 
        employees and customers. I tried to learn the basics while still employeed as I had time which I found very difficult. Now that I am
      unemployed and have some time on my hands I am going to jump right in and learn!</p>
